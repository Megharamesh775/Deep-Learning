      "The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people. Data has shown that the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus can also spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission. The COVID-19 virus can also spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet. This is called presymptomatic transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's possible to get COVID-19 twice or more, but this is uncommon.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of the original virus. Currently, the CDC has identified two variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 as variants of concern. These include the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. The delta variant is more contagious than earlier variants and might cause more severe disease. The omicron variant spreads more easily than other variants, including delta. But omicron appears to cause less severe disease. Omicron has a few major offshoots (sublineages), including BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3.\n",

The FDA has given emergency use authorization to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for ages 5 through 15. The FDA has approved the Moderna vaccine, now called Spikevax, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 18 and older.\n",

      "Due to the risk of a potentially life-threatening blood-clotting problem, the FDA is restricting use of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine to certain people age 18 and older. Examples include people who had a severe allergic reaction after getting an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and people who can't get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine due to limited access or personal or religious concerns. If you get this vaccine, be sure to understand the risks and symptoms of the blood-clotting problem.\n",

However, if you are in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases, the CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public. You're considered fully vaccinated two weeks after you get a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or two weeks after you get a single dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. You are considered up to date with your vaccines if you have gotten all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, when you become eligible.\n",

      "Additional dose. The CDC recommends a third dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for some people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had an organ transplant. People with weakened immune systems might not develop enough immunity after vaccination with two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. An additional dose might improve their protection against COVID-19 . The third dose should be given at least 28 days after a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The additional dose should be the same brand as the other two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses you were given. If the brand given isn't known, either brand of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can be given as a third dose.\n",

For people age 18 or older, the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations. If you are age 18 or older, have been given both doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and it’s been at least 5 months, you should get a single booster dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations.

The Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations. Pregnant women may also receive a COVID-19 booster shot. If you have a weakened immune system, had two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot, and it's been at least three months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose. An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is preferred. If you have a weakened immune system, had one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and it's been at least two months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose.

not have had a strong enough immune response.', 'In contrast, a booster dose is recommended for people who are vaccinated and whose immune response weakened over time.', 'Research suggests that getting a booster dose can decrease your risk of infection and severe illness with COVID-19 .', 'People who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get an additional primary shot and a booster shot.', 'The CDC recommends additional doses and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines in specific instances:\\n\\nAdditional dose.', 'The CDC recommends a third dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for some people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had an organ transplant.', 'People with weakened immune systems might not develop enough immunity after vaccination with two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.', 'An additional dose might improve their protection against COVID-19 .', 'The third dose should be given at least 28 days after a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.', 'The additional dose should be the same brand as the other two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses you were given.', \"If the brand given isn't known, either brand of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can be given as a third dose.\", 'Booster dose.', 'If you are age 12 or older, have been given both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and it’s been at least 5 months, you should get a

preferred in most situations.', 'If you are age 18 or older, have been given both doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and it’s been at least 5 months, you should get a single booster dose.', 'The Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations.', 'If you are age 18 or older, have been given one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and it’s been at least 2 months, you should get a single booster dose.', 'The Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations.', 'Pregnant women may also receive a COVID-19 booster shot.', \"If you have a weakened immune system, had two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot, and it's been at least three months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose.\", 'An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is preferred.', \"If you have a weakened immune system, had one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and it's been at least two months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose.\", 'An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is preferred.', 'Second booster dose.', 'A second booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for certain people who have a weakened immune system and people age 50 or older.', 'This second booster dose can be given to those eligible four months after a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.', 'The FDA has also authorized the monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld) to prevent COVID-19 in some people with weakened immune systems or a history of severe reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine.', 'There are many steps you can take to reduce your risk of infection from the COVID-19 virus and reduce the risk of spreading it to others.', 'WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions:\\n\\nGet vaccinated.', 'COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting and spreading
